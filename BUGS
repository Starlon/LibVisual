In every piece of software you've got bugs and limitations,
libvisual is no exception and we really like well constructed bug
reports.

These are, reproduction example, when possible demonstration application,
gdb backtrace, which plugins are used. or simply ALL THE INFORMATION.

Buggy:
	The whole managed bin sucks. It needs to be rewritten.


Prone for error:
	The libvisual builtin color depth transformation code
	is prone for error when strange pitch sizes are used.

	If you encounter errors like diagonal drawing please
	contact us about this.

	The reason for pitch size is so that when fitting to a buffer
	needs to be done afterwards a depth transformation we can do this
	using the pitch instead of copying all it's data again.

Examples:
	morphsdl examples is broken.
