A playground module for the developers.

Feel free to add useful bits of code, like benchmarks, debugs, tests whatever.

There are also the personal dirs, currently 'dennis', 'vitaly', 'duilio'.

In here are all kind of hacks that don't fit somewhere else but are written by
these guys.

WARNING: Code in this tree does not always represent the right ways of doing
things. The snippits in here shouldn't be bluntly taken as examples. Also the 'hack'
ratio in this tree, is, HIGH. You've been warned.
