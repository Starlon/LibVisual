	Version 0.1.3 has been released.

	* Install lv_log.h
	* Lots and lots of work on the managed bin.
	* Managed bin now seamlessly automaticly morphs from whatever
	  to whatever. (Ok i lied here, the managed bin needs
	  a rewrite, but it SEEMS to work)
	* Better support for openGL.
	* Have requisition method for the actor plugins.
	* Pass audio to the morph plugins.
	* Don't open the plugins with RTL_GLOBAL.

	Version 0.1.2 has been released.

	* Morph plugins (transistion between actors).
	* Event layer for both keyboard, mouse, song change, resolution
	  change.
	* Songinfo system which can be used to set and read songinfo
	  so you can draw text with the song name in visuals (i already
	  fixed this up for the goom plugin, worked out of the box!)
	* The Bin is extended a lot, and i added support for managed
	  bins, where a bin creates it's own actor and input so you
	  don't have to manage those, also you can morph to a new
	  actor using the bin as simple as
	  'visual_bin_switch_actor (bin, actor)' or
	  'visual_bin_switch_actor_by_name (bin, name_of_actor)'.
	* Fixed the issues regarding resize.
	* Have a visual_init and visual_quit, libvisual manages
	  the plugin registry itself now.
	* New plugin layer, instead of a loader for every type there
	  is now an universal plugin loader that wraps the
	  different types in a VisPlugin type.
	* Some small stuff.

2004-04-24  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>
	Version 0.1-pre4 has been released.
	
	* Changed the way plugins are registred, you can now use
	  libvisual_init (&argc, &argv) (or NULL, NULL), also
	  don't forget to do a libvisual_quit ().
	* Made an universal plugin loader instead of separated ones.
	* Random small stuff i forgot about.
