2004-07-09  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* examples/morphsdl.c: Runs again.

2004-07-08  Vitaly V. Bursov  <vitalyvb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvisual/lv_plugin.c: fixed double free() of list
	in visual_plugin_ref_list_destroy()
	* libvisual/lv_list.c: fixed typo in if condition
	in visual_list_destroy()

2004-07-07  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_actor.c:
	(visual_actor_get_next_by_name_gl,
	visual_actor_get_prev_by_name_gl,
	visual_actor_get_next_by_name_nogl,
	visual_actor_get_prev_by_name_nogl):
	New methods.

2004-07-07  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_mem.c: Doc fixes.

2004-07-06  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvisual/lv_mem.c: added.
	* libvisual/lv_video.c: use visual_mem functions.
	* libvisual/lv_list.c: use visual_mem functions.
	* configure.ac: added macro AC_TYPE_SIZE_T required for
	lv_mem.h, and also check for size_t type size.
	* lvconfig.h: addet visual_size_t typedef and 
	VISUAL_SIZE_T_FORMAT macro.

2004-07-05  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_video.c (visual_video_blit_overlay):
	Nearly complete by now.

2004-07-04  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_param.c, libvisual/lv_param.h:
	Very beginning of the param system.

2004-07-02  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvisual/lv_video.c: added flags field to VisVideo
	structure. Now function checks where the screenbuffer
	was allocated by us or was set pointing to an externally
	allocated memory.
	* libvisual/lv_log.h: if the system is GNU, we add printf
	format attribute to lv_log(). This way gcc will print
	warnings if format string doesn't match the number/type
	of variable arguments.

2004-07-01  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_video.c (visual_video_blit_overlay):
	Fscking ehm. I mean negative offsets are kinda
	working, but I'm to tired!

2004-07-01  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_video.c (visual_video_blit_overlay):
	More alpha overlay fixes, now works in 8bits depth
	as well. Only thing left is negative offset values.

2004-07-01  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_video.c (visual_video_blit_fit):
	Deprecated for the overlay function.

	(visual_video_alpha_fill): Added, sets an alpha
	value for the complete context in a VisVideo.

2004-07-01  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_video.c (visual_video_alpha_color):
	Added function that sets a certain color as the
	alpha channel.

	(visual_video_blit_overlay): More work on the alpha
	overlay, getting there.

	* TODO: Updates.

2004-07-01  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_video.c (visual_video_blit_overlay):
	Fixed up, almost completely working alpha support.

	This function will deprecate the blit_fit when it's
	finished.

2004-06-30  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* libvisual/lv_plugin.c: added extensive error checking.
	* libvisual/lv_bin.c: added more error checking to
	visual_bin_sync().
	* libvisual/lv_video.c: Removed temporarily the free()
	call from visual_video_free_buffer(), because we don't
	known if this is memory malloc'ed from us (in XMMS plugin
	this point to the pixels field of the SDL_ScreenSurface
	created by SDL, which can be even a hardware surface).
	* configure.ac: endianness macros renamed to 
	VISUAL_BIG_ENDIAN and VISUAL_LITTLE_ENDIAN.

2004-06-30  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_video.c,
	libvisual/lv_log.c:
	Some doxygen fixes.

2004-06-30  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_video.c:
	Renamed visual_video_fit_in_video to
	visual_video_blit_fit.

	Added visual_video_blit_overlay, no alpha
	support yet tho.

	* libvisual/lv_video.h:
	Changed the prototypes appropiately to the
	changes in lv_video.c.

2004-06-30  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* configure.ac: Remove the check for stdint.h
	and do check for sys/types.h.

	* libvisual/*.c, libvisual/*.h:
	Removed stdint and use sys/types.h for portability
	reasons.

2004-06-29  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: added check for endianess, and set
	LV_BIG_ENDIAN and LV_LITTLE_ENDIAN macros on lvconfig.h
	accordingly.
	* libvisual/lv_bin.c: show messages through visual_log,
	added error checking. Now the XMMS plugin doesn't hang
	the terminal on exit, but still crashing.

2004-06-27  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: output file lvconfig.h with macro
	definitions for the installed LibVisual.
	* libvisual/libvisual.h: added #include <lvconfig.h>.
	* libvisual/lv_log.*: now VISUAL_LOG_ERROR causes to
	program abort. Added visual_log_return_if_fail(expr)
	and visual_log_return_val_if_fail() macros to show
	useful messages.
	* libvisual/*.c: make use of visual_log_return_val_if_fail()
	macro to some modules.
	
2004-06-27  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* NEWS: Updating the NEWS file.

2004-06-26  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: added check for ISOC99 and GNUC varargs
	macros, to be used by visual_log().
	* libvisual/lv_log.* : now visual_log() accepts a format
	string and variable arguments.

2004-06-25  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/lv_libvisual.h: visual_init() signature changed to
	int (*) (int*, char***). Added messages using visual_log().
	* configure.ac: user variable CFLAGS overrided.
	* examples/simplesdl.c: some cleanup to avoid warnings.
	* examples/morphsdl.c: cleanup to avoid warnings, moved
	visual_init() call to use new signature, #include now is
	made relative to the current dir, to use the new libvisual
	instead of the installed one.
	* libvisual/lv_bin.h: added visual_bin_set_morph_by_name()
	and visual_bin_set_steps().
	* libvisual/*.h: changed all function f() declarations to
	funcion f(void), because f() are not valid ISOC99 prototypes.
	* libvisual/lv_plugin.c: with the previous prototypes correction,
	I have found a major bug on visual_plugin_ref_list_destroy()
	when passing a function pointer of incorrect type to 
	visual_list_destroy().
	* libvisual/Makefile.am: to avoid above type errors, added
	compiler flag -Wstrict-prototypes.
	
2004-06-21  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* autogen.sh: check for libtool and run libtoolize --force
	
2004-06-20  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* libvisual/lv_actor.c (visual_actor_video_negotiate):
	Removed unused variable.

	* configure.ac: Renamed AM_PROG_LIBTOOL to AC_PROG_LIBTOOL.

2004-06-20  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: added check for SDL, needed to
	compile the examples.
	* examples/Makefile.am: added, replacing the old
	hand made Makefile.in.
	* libvisual/Makefile.am: included DEFS variable,
	so things like inline will be defined as preprocessor
	define's
	
2004-06-18  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: moved to configure.ac
	* configure.ac: updated to autoconf 2.57 requirements,
	and too much checks added.
	* autogen.sh: script added
	
2004-06-17  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>
	Version 0.1.4 has been released.
	
	* Fixes for SGI regarding time.h
	* Architecture fixes, using precise intergral types from stdint.h
	* Made an builtin bitmap loader, for loading textures and such.
	* Documentated the code using doxygen.
	* Many many cleanups.
	* Made all the enumerate non anonymous.

2004-05-27  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>
	Version 0.1.3 has been released.

	* Install lv_log.h
	* Lots and lots of work on the managed bin.
	* Managed bin now seamlessly automaticly morphs from whatever
	  to whatever. (Ok i lied here, the managed bin needs
	  a rewrite, but it SEEMS to work)
	* Better support for openGL.
	* Have requisition method for the actor plugins.
	* Pass audio to the morph plugins.
	* Don't open the plugins with RTL_GLOBAL.

2004-05-13  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>
	Version 0.1.2 has been released.

	* Morph plugins (transistion between actors).
	* Event layer for both keyboard, mouse, song change, resolution
	  change.
	* Songinfo system which can be used to set and read songinfo
	  so you can draw text with the song name in visuals (i already
	  fixed this up for the goom plugin, worked out of the box!)
	* The Bin is extended a lot, and i added support for managed
	  bins, where a bin creates it's own actor and input so you
	  don't have to manage those, also you can morph to a new
	  actor using the bin as simple as
	  'visual_bin_switch_actor (bin, actor)' or
	  'visual_bin_switch_actor_by_name (bin, name_of_actor)'.
	* Fixed the issues regarding resize.
	* Have a visual_init and visual_quit, libvisual manages
	  the plugin registry itself now.
	* New plugin layer, instead of a loader for every type there
	  is now an universal plugin loader that wraps the
	  different types in a VisPlugin type.
	* Some small stuff.

2004-04-24  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>
	Version 0.1-pre4 has been released.
	
	* Changed the way plugins are registred, you can now use
	  libvisual_init (&argc, &argv) (or NULL, NULL), also
	  don't forget to do a libvisual_quit ().
	* Made an universal plugin loader instead of separated ones.
	* Random small stuff i forgot about.
