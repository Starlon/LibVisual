2004-10-02  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	random functions, use libvisual it's
	VisRandomContext from VisPluginData.

2004-10-01  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

2004-09-29  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/morph/slide/morph_slide.c: Finished
	the plugin, fully working now! YAY.

2004-09-29  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/morph/slide/*: Added slide plugin, this
	is a plugin library, containing 4 plugins (atm).

	Take a look at how it works.

2004-09-22  Duilio Protti <dprotti@user.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	- mplayer input plugin made optional, and don't
	builded if we don't find a munmap().
	- optional building system revamped: visit all 
	directories always, but still possible to disable
	building of any plugin, and dist target still
	working.

2004-09-21  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/actor/lv_analyzer/actor_lv_analyzer.c
	(lv_analyzer_render): Fixed bug with the scale
	factor, now scaling and heights lower than 127
	works, and scaling is more precise (didn't
	float cast an integer calculation).

2004-09-20  Duilio Protti <dprotti@user.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: alsa dependency lowered to 0.9.0.
	* plugins/input/alsa/input_alsa.c: we request the new alsa
	API if we have 0.9.x series installed.

2004-09-13  Duilio Protti <dprotti@user.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/actor/madspin/madspin.c: removed include
	of GLU headers.

2004-09-12  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/input/jack/input_jack.c
	(process_callback): Push the frames.

	* plugins/input/jack/input_jack.c
	(inp_jack_cleanup): Don't try to close a client
	if one was not opened.

	Heya This plugin now rocks[tm]

2004-09-12  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/actor/infinte/lv_infinite.c
	(act_infinite_init):
	Begin with a random effect.

	* plugins/actor/infinite/render.c
	(_inf_renderer): Remove the random
	seed here, we seed at init, which is
	more than anough.

2004-09-12  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>
	
	* plugins/actor/lv_analyzer/actor_lv_analyzer.c
	(lv_analyzer_palette): Build nice palette.

	(lv_analyzer_render): Draw analyzer bars (mostly
	stolen from alsaplayer). Yeah I'm a lazy guy.

	Also removed unused cruft.

2004-09-12  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/input/jack/*: Added jack input plugin.
	Doesn't work yet tho :)

2004-09-10  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* NEWS: Updated.

	Release 0.1.6

2004-09-08  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/*:
	free -> visual_mem_free and the same for malloc
	cleanups.

2004-09-08  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/actor/madspin/madspin.c (lv_madspin_events):
	Actually listen to parameter changes.

	* plugins/actor/lv_gltest/actor_lv_gltest.c
	(lv_gltest_init): Add a parameter for enabling
	transparant bars, and enable this by default.

	(lv_gltest_events): Listen to the new parameter.

2004-09-08  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/input/alsa/input_alsa.c: Changed the buffer request
	size to 1024 so the wave form is actually responding.

2004-09-07  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/input/alsa/input_alsa.c (inp_alsa_init):
	- changed use of snd_pcm_hw_params_alloca() to
	snd_pcm_hw_params_malloc(), otherwise the return value's
	check for NULL doesn't make sense. alloca() is translated
	into a single instruction adjusting the stack pointer, and
	does not check for stack overflow, so there is no NULL error
	return. alloca() is a not portable function.
	- calling snd_pcm_hw_params_set_format() with the correct endianness.
	- changed all VISUAL_LOG_ERROR to VISUAL_LOG_CRITICAL.

2004-09-07  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/actor/gdkpixbuf/actor_gdkpixbuf.c:
	Now fixing the crasher for real, use g_type_init
	instead of gdk_parse_args. All gdkpixbuf needed
	was the g_type_init and calling gdk_parse_args
	more than once in a process was quite fatal so
	to say. Anyway it's fixed now !

	* plugins/actor/bumpscope/actor_bumpscope.c:
	Setting the params as they should be, I still haven't
	fixed the light issue, I don't understand it at all...

2004-09-07  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* configure.ac: Removed xpyre from the build :))

2004-09-06  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/input/mplayer/input_mplayer.c:
	 - manage memory through libvisual.
	 - fix: mmap return -1 on error, not NULL.

2004-09-01  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: added xpyre to build_actor (oops).
	When ALSA check fails, configure is not aborted, just don't builds
	ALSA input plugin. GL detection is leave to installed Libvisual.
	All GL plugin made optionals.

2004-09-01  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/*: Plugins that build are ported to the new plugin system.

	* plugins/madspin/madspin.c (lv_madspin_init): Use params for number
	of stars and speed.

2004-08-27  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/actor/gdkpixbuf/actor_gdkpixbuf.c: Fixed a crasher due
	to gdk over initializing. Not sure if the current fix is 'the way to
	go' tho.

	* plugins/actor/bumpscope/bump_scope.c, bump_scope.h: Checking in.
	Bumpscope kinda works now. Although the light is borked for some
	reason.

	* plugins/actor/bumpscope/actor_bumpscope.c: Params installed.

2004-08-25  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/actor/plazma/*: Ported the xmms plazma plugin!

	* plugins/actor/xpyre/*: Start port of the xmms Xpyre plugin, not finished.

2004-07-23  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/*: Renamed private to priv everywhere to adopt to 
	libvisual API changes.

	* plugins/input/alsa/input_alsa.c: Use VISUAL_LOG_WARNING instead
	of VISUAL_LOG_ERROR when the requested audio output hz is not
	supported but a different one is used, since this is not fatal.

2004-07-13  Gustavo Sverzut Barbieri <gsbarbieri@users.sourceforge.net>
	* plugins/input/mplayer: New input plugin

2004-07-13  Vitaly V. Bursov  <vitalyvb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* plugins/input/alsa/input_alsa.c: Check if
	sample rate was set successfully in another way.
	Try to use a large buffer.
	* plugins/actor/madspin/madspin.c: Free allocated
	textures on cleanup.

	removed, they are already defined on Libvisual.

2004-07-12  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/morph/flash/morph_flash.c (flash_32):
	Renamed to flash_24, seen it was prototyped
	and used in the source like this, aka the plugin
	was broken.

2004-07-09  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/actor/madspin/madspin.c
	(madspin_load_textures): Nicer texture
	filename parsing.

2004-07-09  Dennis Smit  <ds@nerds-incorporated.org>

	* plugins/morph/flash/morph_flash.c
	(replacetable_generate_24): Added function
	to generate color value replacement table
	for 24, 32 bits mode.

	files to SOURCES target.
	* plugins/actor/JESS/Makefile.am: added header

	* configure.ac: videotest plugin removed from the
