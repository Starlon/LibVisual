Copyright (C) 2002-2004  Pierre Tardy

some code based on:

 * Bezier Plugin
 * Copyright (C) 1999 Rick Haines

 *  Blursk - visualization plugin for XMMS
 *  Copyright (C) 1999  Steve Kirkendall


This plugin makes particles dance..

Each particles is linked to the center with a rubber band:
 f = - k * (l-l0) 

and has an interaction force with each other particles:
 f = ag *  (part[i]-part[j])
         ---------------------
          (part[i]-part[j])^3

Whearas this plugin is highly configurable, there is no
configuration dialog.
The configuration is a set of parameter you can edit
in parameters.cc

the plugin can load .epic file made by xfig:
(export "Latex Picture +epic macro")


TODO:
Still many hard coded parameters..
Still lot of dirty code..
