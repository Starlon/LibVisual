Beta versions of G-Force 2.0 are out.  So, why is this G-Force 1.1.6?

Well, the author of G-Force has decided that new versions of G-Force
won't be open source because he thinks that his code was ripped off to
create the Smear plugin for Sonique.  At this time I do not know if
I will ever port G-Force 2.0.
