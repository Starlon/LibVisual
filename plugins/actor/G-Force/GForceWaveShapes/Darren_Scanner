/*Darren Scanner (by Darren Izzard, zysyshelp@yahoo.com)
	- waveshape for G-Force.

  Two lines bounce back and forth about the origin, changing size.
	(actually, I was aiming for an effect more line Darren RScanner, but
	this version had an accidental bug in it which made it look pretty
	good in its own right!)
