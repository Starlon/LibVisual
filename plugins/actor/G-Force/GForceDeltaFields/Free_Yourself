/*  How often I rebel against the One who shows me love that I do not deserve.  He's always there; I just fail to seek Him.

In his novel Mere_Christianity, C.S. Lewis writes:
   "A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg - or he would be the devil of hell. You must take your choice. Either this was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us."

   Indeed.  You're not doing yourself any favors if you to leave these questions unresolved for yourself by keeping your mind always busy with other things.  Think, ponder, make a decision and commit to stand by it.  I offer that one of the choices will take you far while the other will lead you back to where you began.

   There's many good sites, but http://www.ccci.org/whoisjesus/interactive-journey/ is a good site that can introduce you to what being a Christian is really all about.
