Note by Dennis:
Andy O'Meara has done a super job on this plugin, I (Dennis) really
enjoyed making the libvisual interface, and doing bug fixes in the G-Force
code. I personally really like the way G-Force is written, and although it's
a giant codebase, it was one of the easiest plugins to port to libvisual.

Also fixing some bugs regarding waveshape scripts that could put the VM
into semi infinite loops was pretty easy and a joy to do.

I learned a lot from working with this code in a very short time, simply great!


Also Boris, thanks for the port you've done at the time!, without his work
I would never have revived it and ported it to the libvisual framework.


Newer versions of G-Force aren't released as opensource. I've heard that Andy
choose for this path after a suspect commercial, or atleast closed G-Force rip off.

It's Andy his good right to choose this path, and on the bright side, it just leaves
more challenges for us. With that I mean working on support for newer G-Force scripts ! :)
and other neat features.
