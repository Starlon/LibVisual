/* This config just looks dope :-P  It was very easy to make as well.  I simply created a line from (0,0) to (0,1) which reacted to the music.  Then, I made corresponding lines allong each other axis starting from 0 and going in both directions (so each axis had 2 lines, each beginning at (0,0) and extending in an opposite direction).  When I had finished this, I did it again, making the line react in the opposite way to the music (IE, it moved in the other direction).  And then DAMN it looked cool!
Try this config with the deltafield "Nowhere" and the colormap "Acid Gap".  Lordy! */

/* We calculate these up here because they are used several times in the config.  We do this so we don't have to recalculate each time we use them.  Hoorah! */
