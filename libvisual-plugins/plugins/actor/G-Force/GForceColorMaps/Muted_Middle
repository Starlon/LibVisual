 * Muted Middle
 * Written my Stephen Ostermiller (gforce@ostermiller.com)
 * (Check out the mp3 software I have written at
 * www.ostermiller.com)
 *
 * This is my first attempt at writing a color map.
 * The aim with this is to make gforce more colorful.

/*
 * ******    HUE     ******
 *
 * Assign each intensity to a different color.
 * Colors change with time.
 *
 * Dividing i by 2 ensures that the background
 * and the foreground colors will be 180 degrees
 * apart on the color wheel.
 *
 * The .016 is the time scaling factor.  Changing
 * this value effects how fast the colors change
 * in time. (Bigger Value = Change Faster)
 * (If this value is increased, you will need to
 * increase the scaling factor)
 * Right now I have it changing rather slowly.
 * This way, everytime it loads this color map,
 * it will probably look like a new color map because
 * the time is enough different from the last time.

/*
 * ****** SATURATION ******
 * ******   VALUE    ******
 *
 * Saturation and value have the same formula.
 * The idea is to make the background and
 * foreground colors be the brightest.
 * I don't want stuff in between to be the focus
 * of my attention, so it is muted.
