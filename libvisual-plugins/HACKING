If you'd like to hack on/using/for libvisual bear in mind the
following:

Communication:
	I think it's very important to communicate with each other
	to give directions, avoid duplication of work and to share
	ideas. If you're planning to developer something for or
	using libvisual, please subscribe to the mailinglist that
	can be found www.sf.net/projects/libvisual/.

	Libvisual isn't something static, if something is borked
	or really should be done different, don't hack around it
	but bring it up. Libvisual is there to rock, and thus we
	should fix at the core, not the layer above.

	If you're a plugin writing and you're missing something
	in the host platform, that is libvisual, please tell us
	we are eager to fix it and make it better.

Codestyle:
	Libvisual:
		Use the code style that is present in libvisual,
		i'm not going to describe the complete codestyle
		in this document rather just look at the source
		and copy the style. I'm very strict when it
		comes to the codestyle within libvisual so obey it
		when you write something.

	Plugins:
		Many plugins present have been ported over from
		other applications and players, especially from
		xmms plugins. Lots have changed within the plugins
		for example all use a private for their data to
		ensure reentrance and multiple instances. The code
		style is often not as it should be and mixed.

		I think the best situation would be to have the plugins
		have the same code style as libvisual.

	Tests:
		These are just hacks, ignore them :)

Patches:
	When you send me patches, send them in unified format, using
	diff -u.
