Blursk-libvisual is a visualization plugin for libvisual.
It was originally written by Steve Kirkendall, and was
ported to libvisual by starlon and rigid. Below is 
directly from the original Blursk's README. Below that
I've included as reference all configuration options.

----------------------------------------------------------

Blursk is a visualization plugin for XMMS.  It was inspired
by the "Blur Scope" plugin, but Blursk goes far beyond that.
It supports a variety of colormaps, blur patterns, plotting
styles, and other options.  The only things that haven't
changed are parts of the XMMS interface and configuration
code.

To configure Blursk, select it in the Visualization Plugin
menu, and then click the [Configure] button, as usual.  If
Blursk is running while you're configuring it, then you can
see the effects of your changes immediately as you make them.

Right-clicking on the Blursk window will also bring up the
configuration dialog.  Dragging the left mouse button will
move the window, and Blursk will even remember that position
the next time you start it.

Blursk allows you to store combinations of settings as a
"preset".  The preset controls are located at the top of
the configuration dialog, above the options.  The controls
consist of a combo box where you can type in the name of a
preset, and three buttons for loading/saving/erasing the
preset named in the combo box.  Changing the name in the
combo box has no direct affect on the configuration; you
must press one of the buttons to make something happen.

As a special case, loading "Random preset on quiet" will
cause Blursk to randomly choose one of the other presets
each time silence is detected on the input.  You can end the
random choices by loading any other preset, or by altering
any property of the current preset.

Blursk also supports a variety of full-screen modes.  First
you must configure the full-screen method by clicking the
[Advanced] button on the Configure dialog.  (The full-
screen options are described at the end of this file.)
After that, you should be able to switch to full-screen
mode by typing <Alt-Enter> or <F> in the Blursk window.
To switch back, hit <Alt-Enter> again.

=============================================================
OPTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------

BASE COLOR
    This allows you to select the drawing color.  Some
    colormaps add extra colors, but all of them will use
    this color as a reference in one way or another.

COLOR OPTIONS
    The first item here is the color style.  It controls the
    way that Blursk will generate a color map.  In addition
    to a variety of hardcoded color styles, there is also a
    "Random" setting which causes one of the other color
    maps to be chosen at random; in addition, each time the
    blur motion changes (see below), a new color map will be
    chosen.

    The fade options come next.  Images are always drawn in
    the color at one end of the color map (usually the
    brightest end); over time, the image color is shifted
    toward the other end of the color map.  This option
    controls the speed at which this shifting takes place.

    The next option determines which color the signal will
    be drawn in.  "Normal signal" uses the brightest color,
    "White signal" forces the brightest color to be white,
    and "Cycling signal" causes the signal to be drawn in
    different colors.

    Setting the "Contour lines" flag will add some other
    white lines to the color map.

    Setting "Hue on beats" will cause a different base color
    to be chosen when Blursk detects beats in the music.
    Unfortunately, the beat detector isn't very good yet.

    The default background color is "Black backgnd", but
    you can also choose "White" (really light gray),
    "Dark" (a dark version of the base color), "Shift"
    (120 degrees around the color wheel from the base
    color), "Color" (a random color), or "Flash" (the
    background color flickers in response to the music).

BLUR OPTIONS
    Blur motion is the first option in this group.  It
    determines the way that the image's pixels drift.
    There are many blur motions supported here, plus
    "Random", "Random slow", and "Random quiet" settings
    which cause one of the other blur motions to be chosen
    randomly, either at regular intervals or at the start
    of a quiet period.

    Next is the switching speed.  When you change blur
    styles (or "Random" does it for you), the new style
    doesn't instantly replace the old style.  It happens
    gradually, under control of the switch speed option.

    The third option in this section controls the type of
    blurring.

    Next is the "stencil" option.  Blursk contains a
    variety of bitmapped images; this options allows you
    to incorporate one of the images into the blur motion
    in a subtle way.  "Random stencil" chooses one of the
    images randomly whenever the blur motion changes.
    "Maybe stencil" does the same except that it usually
    chooses no image at all.

    The "Slow motion" option cuts the frame rate in half.
    This slows down the image's motion, and it also reduces
    the CPU load.

EFFECTS
    The first option in this section controls the way that
    the sound signal is converted to an (X,Y) position in
    the window.

    The next option controls the way that those points are
    plotted on the window.  The "Radar" setting is unusual
    in that it uses the X value as a radius, and the Y value
    as a brightness.  "Edges" also uses Y as a brightness,
    and uses X to select a position along the perimeter of
    the window.

    The "Thick on beats" flag attempts to make the renderer
    use thicker lines when the sound is loud.  For some
    combinations of options, this can make the entire image
    seem to throb in step with the music.

    The next option controls flashing.  When Blursk detects
    a beat, it can brighten the whole image, invert the
    whole image, or add a bitmap image (from the same pool
    or images as the "blur stencil" option).  If this option
    is set to "Random flash", then it will choose a bitmap
    randomly; except if the stencil option is also random,
    then blursk will use the stencil bitmap for flashing.

    The effect option is next.  The "Normal effect" converts
    the pixel values to colors directly.  The "Bump effect"
    interprets the pixel values as heights, and chooses a
    color based on height differences to achieve a cheap
    3D effect.  The "Anti-fade effect" cycles the colormap
    at exactly the same speed as fading, so that pixels tend
    to remain the same color as they fade, so you see mostly
    the blurring and motion but not the fading.  The "Ripple
    effect" causes the fade to be subtly nonlinear.

    The "floaters" option offers a way to spice up some
    of the more sedate configurations.  "Dots" causes random
    flashing dots to be added to the image.  The other values
    add persistent dots which follow the blur motion, leaving
    trails.

=============================================================
ADVANCED OPTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------

MISCELLANY
    The "CPU speed" option gives you a simple way to affect
    the CPU load, by changing the image resolution.  The
    "Fast CPU" setting uses the full resolution of the
    window.  "Medium CPU" reduces the horizontal resolution
    by half, and then interpolates points to expand the
    image to fill the window.  The blur motions will be
    distorted, but it should still look interesting.  The
    "Slow CPU" setting reduces both vertical and horizontal
    resolution.

    The "Show window title" option causes the Blursk window
    to be displayed as a normal application window, with a
    title bar.  Normally it is displayed without a title
    bar, like a dialog, but some window managers don't let
    dialogs choose their own position.  This option is
    normally off; if Blursk is unable to create its window
    where you normally want it, then try turning this
    option on.

    The "Show info" option causes the track number and song
    title to be shown in the image.

BEAT SENSITIVITY
    The beat sensitivity slider affects the beat sensor,
    which is used by the "hue on beats", "blur on beats",
    and "flash" features.  Moving the slider to the left
    makes it less sensitive; moving it right increases
    sensitivity.  Sadly, this isn't nearly as effective as
    I'd hoped.
