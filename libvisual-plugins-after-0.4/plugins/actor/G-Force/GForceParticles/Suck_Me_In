/* Suck Me In, by Jeff Osborn (jo009j@mail.rochester.edu)
This config began with me messing around with circles, and the "NUM" parameter.  Eventually I got something which looked pretty cool, and an idea began to take shape in my mind.  I scrapped what I had, and began from scratch.  Soon I had what I was looking for; the trouble was it looked like shit :-P  So I messed around with the "LWdt" and "Pen" parameters until it looked better.  When I looked at it then, it looked like it wanted to suck me into it.  So, I named it "Suck Me In".  Interesting, eh?"
