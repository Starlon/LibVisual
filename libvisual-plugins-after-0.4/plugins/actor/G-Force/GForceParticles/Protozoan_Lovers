/* Protozoan Lovers, by Jeff Osborn (jo009j@mail.rochester.edu) 
This is another example of just hacking around.  I had an idea (which I still have to impliment... :-P), and on my way to creating it I made something else which looked cool.  I started refining that, and came up with this :-)  It reminds me of one celled organisms dancing around under a microscpe, so I called it "Protozoan Lovers". */

/* Two line sections are drawn, using ID to offset each one.  Each one of the two sections belongs to a different protozoa.  The protozoa move along sin(t), and then along another sin(t)...so, a sin() curve along a sin() curve.  Thats how it moves "randomly".
