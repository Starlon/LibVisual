		libgoom:
			goom links to too much stuff
			is goom linking to the right thingies?
			leaking quite seriously

			as an xmms plugin using SDL! now we need to port it to libvisual :))

	a gdkpixbuf image loader:
		make

	auto sched plugin:
		have a auto schedded bin running in an actor so that

			the auto scheduler.

	More: (post 0.2)
